      In this experiment, you will first hear 30 phrases in an artificial language. This language uses the same as words as English but nevertheless, slightly differs from English. After hearing these translations, you will be asked to provide 50 translations
      to short phrases. The HIT should take ~10 minutes. Please pay attention, thanks!</p>
